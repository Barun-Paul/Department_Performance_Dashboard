## üîé Project Overview

This repository contains a Power BI solution to help leadership **manage the workforce, understand financial risks, and monitor project health**.

> **Key Business Question**  
> Which **projects** and **departments** are at risk of being **over budget** or **underperforming**?  
> Budgets are set on **2-year intervals**, but leadership needs to see if **a 1-year budget can cover all expenses**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Identify Departments & Projects in the Red**  
   Spotlight areas that are **over budget** or **underperforming** so corrective action can be taken.

2. **Data Organization**  
   Structure and validate inputs from multiple sources:
   - Employee information  
   - Salary data  
   - Department budgets  
   - Project details  

3. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   Deliver a comprehensive dashboard with visibility into:
   - Employee performance & headcount cost
   - Salary distribution and trends
   - Departmental project status
   - Financial risk and budget coverage

## üßÆ Metrics & KPIs (Examples)

- **Budget Variance (‚Çπ / %)** = Actuals ‚àí Budget; (Actuals / Budget ‚àí 1)
- **Run-Rate / Burn** = YTD Actuals √∑ Months Elapsed
- **Forecast to Complete (FTC)** = YTD Actuals + Remaining Forecast
- **Year-1 Coverage Check** = (Year-1 Budget ‚àí Year-1 Forecasted Spend)
- **Project Health** = composite score (Schedule, Cost, Quality signals)
- **Salary Distribution** = median, p10/p90, departmental spread

> Note: Model supports **2-year budget windows** with a dedicated calculation to test **1-year coverage**.

## üß± Data Model (Expected Inputs)

- **Employees**: EmployeeID, DeptID, Role, JoinDate, Status  
- **Salaries**: EmployeeID, Month, BasePay, Bonus, Benefits  
- **Departments**: DeptID, DeptName, Manager, CostCenter  
- **Budgets**: DeptID, ProjectID, FiscalYear, Period, BudgetAmount, Interval (1Y/2Y)  
- **Projects**: ProjectID, DeptID, ProjectName, StartDate, EndDate, Status, PlannedCost, ActualCost

You can map your fields to these expected columns via **Power Query**.
